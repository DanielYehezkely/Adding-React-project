# Website Conversion - HTML/CSS/JS to React

This project is a **conversion of a website** originally built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, now rebuilt using **React**. The goal of this conversion was to improve the websiteâ€™s maintainability, scalability, and component-based structure using React.

## Overview

The original version of this website was created using traditional web development technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). I later refactored it using **React** to leverage modern development practices such as reusable components, state management, and more efficient DOM manipulation.

The converted project features the same design and functionality but is now structured using React components.

## Features

- **Component-Based Structure**: The website is organized into reusable components for better maintainability.
- **State Management**: Certain features that require dynamic interaction are managed using React's `useState` hook.
- **Responsive Design**: The website remains fully responsive across various screen sizes.
- **Improved Performance**: Using React's virtual DOM for optimized rendering and updates.
- **Modern Development Practices**: Conversion to React allows easier scaling and future updates.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic for the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the components and ensuring responsiveness.
- **HTML5**: Used within the JSX structure of React.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for React.
3. Start the development server to view the React version of the website locally.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Acknowledgments

- This project originally began as a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I converted it to React to learn and implement modern web development practices.
